Hi, I'm George and this is my blog. 

I am a computer science student at the University of Birmingham. And yes, I didn't 
capitalise computer science; [here's why](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/223162).

My hobbies and interests include: 
- Programming (I'm in the [building things for people to use](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/)
 tribe)
- Photography
- Playing Tennis
- Running
- Listening to Music (follow me on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/profile/gsbaker))

You can find more about me by visiting my [personal webpage](https://www.gsbaker.uk).
